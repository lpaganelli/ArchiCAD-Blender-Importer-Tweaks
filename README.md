# ArchiCAD-Blender-Importer-Tweaks
This plugin is a collection of three useful tools for cleaning up and preparing models imported from Archicad.

## Features:

- Remove duplicate vertices: This tool can remove duplicate vertices from the model, which can improve performance and reduce file size.
- Apply gamma 2 to colors of all materials without texture: This tool can apply a gamma of 2 to the colors of all materials in the model that do not have a texture. This can help to improve the appearance of the model in Blender.
- Adjust metalness, roughness, and glossiness of all materials to default values: This tool can adjust the metalness, roughness, and glossiness of all materials in the model to their default values. This can be useful if you want to start with a clean slate when working on your materials.
